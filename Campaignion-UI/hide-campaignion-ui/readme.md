Sometimes, you want to make the logged-in version of your Campaignion action look like the logged-out version.

Maybe you have not published the page yet and want to see what it'll look like for your supporters.

Use these instructions to remove the menu bars, tabs, make the background colour of your content transparent and so on.

1. Install the Stylus extension. [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/). [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)

2. [Save this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traidcraft-Exchange/Code-for-Campaigns/master/Campaignion-UI/hide-campaignion-ui/stylus-hide-campaignion-admin-ui.json). Holing Ctrl or Cmd (Mac), then pressing the 'S' key will save it. The file includes the rules to hide the Campaignion Admin user interface

3. Open the Stylus options. Click on the {S} logo in your browser add-ons section. Select 'Options'

4. Click X on the pop-up

5. Click 'Import' on the bottom right, then 'Import styles'

6. Select the file you downloaded in Step 2. It will import those rules.

7. Select the {S} logo again. Select the Pencil next to "Hide Admin UI on Campaignion"

8. At the bottom of that page, change the URL from "action.traidcraft.org.uk" to the URL of your Campaignion site

9. To toggle the Campaignion Admin user interface to On and Off, select the {S} logo. Then toggle the checkbox to the right of "Hide Admin UI on Campaignion"

Done.
